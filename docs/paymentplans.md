I think we should implement plans for for example:
monthly, 3 months, 6 months, yearly, lifetime(limited time)

this payments should be done via stripe (we will create a stripe account for this)
we
we will have a page where users can choose how to pay, and we will have a page where users can see their payments and their status.

The plan has to be directly added to the user's profile and it should be visible in the dashboard. Also how many time or days are left in this plan. (this should be counting properly)
