---- add the fact that we currently have only email auth working
---- add the fact that we will need to have google ads for monetization.
---- add the fact both on onboarding and on our dev roadmap here that we need to make this project closed source as a real saas and charge users right after they make a demo acc. if they dont, we give them 30 days for free for everyone either way... or something smarter. but in the same idea.
