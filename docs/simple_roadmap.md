# AscendOSRS - Simplified MVP Roadmap üöÄ

## Philosophy: "Working First, Pretty Later"

### Realistic Principles
- **Critical Bugs First**: If it doesn't work, it's worthless
- **1 Environment Only**: Production working 100%
- **Functional MVP**: User pays ‚Üí gets access ‚Üí stays happy
- **No Over-Engineering**: Simple solutions that work
- **Vibe Coding**: MCP + Cursor AI decisions, well-documented code
- **No CMS/Admin Panel**: Direct database management for MVP

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Constraints
- **No Test Environment**: All testing on prod with Stripe sandbox
- **No CMS/Admin Panel**: Direct database operations for user management
- **GitHub Commits**: Primary rollback method
- **Supabase Backups**: Database recovery system
- **MCP Connected**: Cursor AI with full database visibility
- **Well Documented**: Code must be self-explanatory for vibe coding

## üîß Manual User Management (No CMS Approach)

### Database Operations Documentation
```sql
-- Grant premium access to user
UPDATE user_premium_status 
SET plan_type = 'monthly', 
    end_date = NOW() + INTERVAL '1 month',
    status = 'active'
WHERE user_id = 'user_email@gmail.com';

-- Check user payment status
SELECT * FROM user_premium_status 
WHERE user_id = 'user_email@gmail.com';

-- View all active premium users
SELECT u.email, ups.plan_type, ups.end_date 
FROM users u 
JOIN user_premium_status ups ON u.id = ups.user_id 
WHERE ups.status = 'active';
```

### Testing Without CMS
- **Stripe Sandbox**: All payment testing on live prod
