## CLARIFICATIONS & ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- **ALL data must be round-tripped:** Not just "save" but "load" must restore *exactly* what was saved, for all fields, including booleans (active/inactive), numbers, and arrays/objects. Test by saving, then loading in an anonymous/incognito browser and verifying all data is present and correct.
- **No forced defaults on load:** If a field is missing in the DB, the app should not overwrite user data with defaults. Never overwrite user data with defaults on load; always preserve what was saved.
- **Backend must support all new fields:** Supabase Edge Function must be patched to save/load all new fields, including is_member, image_url, preferences, and any future fields.
- **Frontend must send/receive all fields:** Frontend cloudDataService and useAppData must send and receive all fields, and strictly replace state on load.
- **Thumbnails:** Thumbnails must be pulled from open source (OSRS Wiki recommended), and fallback to placeholder if not available.
- **Sync with OSRS Wiki regularly:** Money making methods and item lists must be updated regularly from OSRS Wiki to stay current.
- **User Preferences:** User preferences (JSONB) must be round-tripped and editable in the future.
- **Error Handling:** All save/load and import/export operations must have robust error handling and user feedback.
- **No duplicate or orphaned data:** When importing or saving, do not create duplicate or orphaned records.
- **Favorites:** Allow users to favorite items/methods for quick access (future enhancement, but track in ToDo).

## BACKEND / SUPABASE / INFRA TODOs

- [ ] Patch Supabase Edge Function to save/load all fields (character stats, hours/day, isActive, is_member, image_url, preferences, etc.)
- [ ] Update Supabase DB schema to ensure all new fields exist and are correct (run latest migrations)
- [ ] Add support for user preferences (JSONB) and ensure round-trip in API
- [ ] Ensure all new fields are handled in both save and load actions
- [ ] Confirm Supabase project is using the latest migration and schema
